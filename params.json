It is compulsory for the [Specialization in Software Engineering](http://www.fib.upc.edu/en/estudiar-enginyeria-informatica/especialitats-grau/enginyeria-del-software.html).\r\n\r\nMore info: <http://www.fib.upc.edu/en/estudiar-enginyeria-informatica/assignatures/ASW.html>\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
